Hi! Welcome to my first blog post about my internship at Enepath.

Let’s start by explaining what exactly Enepath is all about. Enepath is an all-in-one communication service provider. Their target audience consists primarily of financial traders. The product itself is a tablet that runs their own custom software to manage incoming and outgoing calls. Such a tablet can be upgraded with a dock, a high quality microphone, a handset and up to 36 speakers. In order for the tablets to receive or make calls, an advanced backend has been engineered to deliver a smooth and high quality experience along with a network that can be configured according to the customers needs.

My job at Enepath is to redesign the ‘config node’ or ‘admin panel’ to make it more easier to use and look more appealing. I started out by researching the application to understand the functionality it provided. I then interviewed some colleagues, who are frequent users of the application, to answer some general user experience questions.

After thoroughly researching the application and interviewing it’s users, I then focused on redesigning the menu. Due to the high diversity of functionality the application provides, a well structured menu is mandatory to quickly and easily navigate through the application.
With the help of [Trello](https://trello.com/b/OYnl2H1d/enepath-menu) I was able to easily organise the many different menu items in different groups. These groups would form the main building blocks of the new menu. I tested the newly configured menu by making sketches and asking my colleagues to navigate to a certain functionality. It became clear that there was some confusion about the naming of the groups and certain menu items were still not that obvious to locate. With the help of my colleagues we quickly addressed these issues.

With the menu approved, I continued making sketches of the most used functionalities. After putting these through the same testing, I could start turning my sketches into digital designs. At Odisee I’ve learned to design web applications with Photoshop. That was about 3 years ago and I have not used Photoshop since. Having recently discovered a web design program called [Sketchapp](https://www.sketchapp.com/), I decided to devote a day to learning how to use it. Sketchapp is a macOS application, specifically created for designing everything related to web and mobile, whereas photoshop is a complex tool that serves many purposes. In less than a day I was able to learn the fundamentals and I quickly turned my sketches into digital designs.

My first weeks at Enepath have already been an enriching experience. I gained experience with a new tool and I was able to apply my previously acquired UX knowledge to a real product.

Thank you for reading my very first blog post!
